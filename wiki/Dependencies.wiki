This library is currently uses Jquery, this allows for simpler selection of DOM elements and provides some nice bells and whistles with relative ease. when I started I took the latest version, which at the time was 1.4.2 The code may run with other versions, both older and newer.

I have also made use of the SACK library developed by http://www.twilightuniverse.com/ this library seems to be fairly 'finished' now. The creator made it for a set purpose, kept it compact and simple. This web-windows uses version 1.6 of SACK.

Apart from those two libraries of code, you should be fairly good to go. If you can't get this code to work, make sure you are using a compatible browser (I will try to make it more cross compatible, but it honestly is not such an issue for me, I use Chrome)
